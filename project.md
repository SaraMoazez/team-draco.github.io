### Sprint 1: 20–24 April  <img width='2.5%' src="sprintgbn (1).png?raw=true"/> 
**Sprint Goal**: You should be able to open the app and create a flashcard

**Stories:**
* Create flashcards with text
* There should be a template with which you create flashcards
<br>In addition to these stories, we also worked with basic functionality from the app's core screens

**Unplanned items** – we completed our sprint goal quickly and could therefore begin work on more stories:
* The order of questions should be random in flashcards
* We also began looking at things we were going to work with during sprint 1, mainly database, profile and login

**Demo Date:** 24 April 08:30

### Sprint 3: 5–11 May  <img width='2.5%' src="sprintgbn (1).png?raw=true"/>
